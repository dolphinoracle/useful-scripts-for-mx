The files here will create system sounds at login and logout.

put 

startupsound
logoutsound
xfce4-session
pulse-start

in /usr/local/bin.  All must be set executable.

for event sounds other than login:
install:  libcanberra-gstreamer, libcanberra-pulse, and libcanberra-gtk-module.
put 52canberra-gtk-module in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/

custom thunar action:
makecustomstartupsound-customthunaraction contains custom Thunar actions for setting custom login and logout.

assumptions:
The script assumes that a sound theme is installed in /usr/share/sounds and is defined in xfconf.  
If no sound theme is installed, user can still select customs login and logout sounds.
