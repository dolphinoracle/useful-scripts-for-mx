The files here will create system sounds at login and logout.

put 

startupsound
logoutsound
xfce4-session

in /usr/local/bin.  All must be set executable.

for event sounds other than login/logout:
run the following as root to install canberra for system event sounds
apt-get install libcanberra-gstreamer libcanberra-pulse libcanberra-gtk-module.
and put 
52canberra-gtk-module 
in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/

custom thunar action:
makecustomstartupsound-customthunaraction contains 
custom Thunar actions for setting custom login and logout sounds.
copy and paste contens of this file into
~/.config/Thunar/uca.xml
just before the last </action>

assumptions:
The script assumes that a sound theme is installed in 
/usr/share/sounds 
and is defined in xfconf.  
If no sound theme is installed, user can still select 
custom login and logout sounds through thunar custom action.

Borealis sound theme is provide for your convienence.
usr_share_sounds_borealis.tar.gz
extract this file into /usr/share/themes/

In Xfconf (Xfce Settings Editor) find this value:
xsettings>SoundThemeName  and set to chosen theme (ie: Borealis)
make sure to save the change.

In Appearance, enable Event Sounds on Settings Tab.  You can enable both 
checkboxes for even more sounds.
