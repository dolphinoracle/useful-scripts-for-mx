The files here will create system sounds at login and logout.

put 

startupsound
logoutsound
xfce4-session

in /usr/local/bin.  All must be set executable.
reboot for these changes to go into effect.
on first login, you may need to set pavucontrol systemsounds to 100% (might be 0 by default)

custom thunar action:
makecustomstartupsound-customthunaraction contains 
custom Thunar actions for setting custom login and logout sounds.
copy and paste contens of this file into
~/.config/Thunar/uca.xml
just before the last </action>

The script assumes that a sound theme is installed in 
/usr/share/sounds 
and is defined in xfconf.  
If no sound theme is installed, user can still select 
custom login and logout sounds through thunar custom action.
